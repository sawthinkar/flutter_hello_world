# Flutter Sandbox

• Write your first Flutter app, part 1  
<https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab>  

• Navigate to a new screen and back  
<https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics>

• Files from `/build/web/*` are moved to `/docs/*`, so that GitHub Pages can run.  

• `base href` from `/docs/index.html` is commented out.

``` markdown
  <!--
    If you are serving your web app in a path other than the root, change the
    href value below to reflect the base path you are serving from.

    The path provided below has to start and end with a slash "/" in order for
    it to work correctly.

    Fore more details:

  <!-- <base href="/"> -->
